# Methods and Return Values: Parrot Lab

## Learning Goals

- Define a method that accepts arguments.
- Create a default argument.
- Practice returning a value.

## Instructions

In this lab you'll be defining a method called `parrot`.

The `parrot` method should accept an argument of a string and both `puts` out
that string _and_ return the string at the end of the method.

The `parrot` method should have a default argument of `"Squawk!"`.

**Note:** _This lab is explicitly testing your ability to control the return
value of a method, not just what it does, but what it returns. Remember, return
values are important. Ask yourself? what is the return value of `puts`?_
